DESCRIPTION:
This script was made in order to help OmniPCX Enterprise administrator to have a visualization of what external DID goes to what user.
It takes a DID Translation spead-sheet like in first argument, and a user list in 2nd argument. The result of this file are displayed
on the console put the output can be redirected toward a TSV (Tabulation Separated) file.

Description:
This script reads the data from 2 files passed in argument:
- The DID Translator table, with 4 columns only (external number, internal number, range, unique)
- The list of users, with 3 columns only (extension, lase name, first name)
- Both files must be in TSV Format (Tabulation Separated) and have headers in the files (headers can be named anything)
- TSV Files are the result of OmniVista 8770 export. You'll just need to clean up the files and remove any unwanted column.
